# Mercury 2 Programmer

The `mercury2_prog` application is a command-line utility for programming the [Mercury 2 FPGA board](https://micro-nova.com/mercury-2) via the onboard FT2232H USB-to-serial adapter. It can currently communicate with the S25FL116K (16Mbit), S25FL132K (32Mbit) and S25FL164K (64Mbit) SPI flash chips.

Port A of the FT2232H is used by this application for configuration. Port B is free for user applications. See the [Mercury 2 schematic](https://www.micro-nova.com/s/Mercury2_schematic.pdf) for a detailed look at how the FT2232H is wired to the FPGA and SPI flash.

## Usage

- `-h` or `--help` prints a help message describing these options
- `-l` or `--list` lists all visible FTDI devices, and attempts to find Mercury 2 boards
- `-e` or `--erase` erases the entire SPI flash on the Mercury 2
- `-r` or `--read` reads the entire SPI flash and saves it to `dump.bit`
- `-w` or `--write` writes to the SPI flash using the specified file. For example: `./mercury2_prog -w test.bit`. (Note that this command will automatically erase the required blocks before writing.)

## Build

The `mercury2_prog` application is compiled on Linux using `make`. This has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 using gcc 7.4.0 and mingw32-gcc-7.3. The build produces two binaries:
- `mercury2_prog` - a native x86-64 Linux application
- `mercury2_prog.exe` - a cross-compiled x86-64 Windows application

Note that you must `sudo apt-get install mingw-tools mingw-w64-tools` to cross-compile for Windows.

## Sample Output

```
$ ./mercury2_prog -w mercury2_blink.bit
